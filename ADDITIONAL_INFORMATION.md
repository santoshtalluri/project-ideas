# Additional Information

My motivation to join the OpenAI Residency Program is deeply personal and rooted in a transformation enabled by your technology.

Despite having 8 years of product management experience shipping products at companies like Nvidia and ServiceNow, I never worked as a software engineer. However, over the last few months, I have built and deployed two complex, production-ready applications—**Tailor Resume MCP** (a microservices-based resume platform) and **TraceBuddy** (a real-time geolocation iOS app)—using what I call "vibe coding" with AI.

This experience provided a profound realization: **we are on the cusp of a revolution where domain experts, regardless of their coding fluency, can build sophisticated software to solve real-world problems.**

I am applying because I want to help accelerate this future. I bring a unique perspective: an expert Product Manager who understands enterprise needs, combined with the fresh, hands-on experience of a "non-technical" builder empowered by LLMs. I want to bridge the gap between advanced AI research and practical, user-centric application, ensuring that AGI truly empowers all of humanity to create, build, and solve.
