# Tailor Resume MCP - Product Pitch Document

## Executive Summary

Tailor Resume MCP is an AI-powered resume customization platform that helps job seekers automatically tailor their resumes to match specific job requirements. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the platform solves the critical problem of resume format incompatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and the time-consuming process of manually customizing resumes for each job application.

**Target User**: Job seekers actively applying to multiple positions who need to customize their resumes quickly and accurately.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform hours of manual resume customization into minutes of automated, AI-powered tailoring that ensures ATS compatibility regardless of resume format.

## Problem Statement Analysis

### Problem 1: Resume Format Incompatibility with ATS Systems
**The Problem**: Over 75% of resumes are rejected by ATS systems before reaching human recruiters, primarily due to formatting issues. Traditional ATS parsers fail to accurately extract information from resumes with non-standard layouts, creative designs, or unconventional structures. A resume that looks perfect to the human eye may be completely unreadable to an ATS system.

**Impact**: Qualified candidates are automatically filtered out, reducing their chances of landing interviews. Job seekers spend hours reformatting resumes to match different ATS requirements, often creating multiple versions of the same resume.

**Current Solutions**: Manual reformatting, using ATS-friendly templates (which limit creativity), or hiring professional resume writers (costly and time-consuming).

### Problem 2: Time-Consuming Manual Resume Customization
**The Problem**: Job seekers applying to multiple positions must manually customize their resumes for each job posting, highlighting relevant skills, experiences, and keywords. This process can take 30-60 minutes per application, making it impractical to apply to many positions.

**Impact**: Job seekers limit the number of applications they submit, reducing their chances of finding employment. The manual process is error-prone, leading to missed keywords or improperly emphasized experiences.

**Current Solutions**: Generic resumes (low success rate), manual customization (time-consuming), or resume writing services (expensive and not scalable).

### Problem 3: Inconsistent Resume Data Extraction
**The Problem**: When job seekers need to extract their resume data for other purposes (job boards, networking sites, portfolio websites), they must manually re-enter information. Different platforms require different formats, leading to inconsistencies and data entry errors.

**Impact**: Time wasted on repetitive data entry, inconsistencies across platforms, and potential errors that could affect professional reputation.

**Current Solutions**: Manual data entry, copy-paste (error-prone), or using resume builders (limited flexibility).

### Problem 4: Lack of Job-Resume Matching Intelligence
**The Problem**: Job seekers struggle to identify which aspects of their experience are most relevant to a specific job posting. Without guidance, they may emphasize the wrong skills or miss critical keywords that ATS systems are looking for.

**Impact**: Resumes don't align with job requirements, leading to lower match scores in ATS systems and reduced interview opportunities.

**Current Solutions**: Manual analysis (time-consuming and subjective), career counselors (expensive and not always available), or generic advice (not job-specific).

### Problem 5: Resume Version Management Complexity
**The Problem**: Job seekers create multiple versions of their resumes for different job types, industries, or career levels. Managing these versions, keeping them updated, and ensuring consistency becomes increasingly difficult as the number of versions grows.

**Impact**: Outdated information in some versions, confusion about which version to use, and time wasted searching through multiple files.

**Current Solutions**: Manual file management, naming conventions (error-prone), or document management systems (not designed for resumes).

## Primary Problem We Are Solving

**Problem #1: Resume Format Incompatibility with ATS Systems**

**Why This Problem Matters Most**:
- It affects 100% of job seekers using ATS systems
- It's the leading cause of resume rejection (75% rejection rate)
